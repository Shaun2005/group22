  <h1>Our Vision</h1>
  <p>The vision of Mr John Doe and the Movement For Change is to have a country where the future is prioritized.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>EDUCATION:</strong> A modernized education system to meet the demands of the modern world as well as equip students with the requisite knowledge and skills to achieve greater things. Build ultramodern schools and equip them with the necessary equipments to meet the demands of the technology.</li>
    <li><strong>HEALTHCARE:</strong> Making Healthcare Free for all citizens of the country. Build ultramodern healthcare facilities and equip them with the necessary machineries to ensure there is quality in the delivery of healthcare as well as good healthcare facilities and enough beds to accommodate hundreds. Our vision is to make our country the number one destination for quality healthcare services where people would rather fly in the country to access quality healthcare rather than people flying to the western world for healthcare.</li>
    <li><strong>AGRICULTURE:</strong> To train and encourage the youth to develop passion for agriculture to reduce the importation of foodstuff. Rather than importing foodstuffs, we can grow what we eat.</li>
    <li><strong>TRANSPORTATION:</strong> To make transporting foodstuffs easier, we will prioritize fixing all roads which are in poor shape as well as constructing new roads to connect various localities together. We will also create a National Airline to help in the movement of people from one geographical area to another.</li>
    <li><strong>YOUTH AND EMPLOYMENT:</strong> Our focus is to create jobs for the youth. Not just create jobs but to create well paying jobs. We will make sure the youth donâ€™t sit at home doing nothing but will have jobs to ensure they can make some money.</li>
  </ul>
